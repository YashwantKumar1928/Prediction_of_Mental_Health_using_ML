The "AI-Powered Mental Health Prediction" project uses machine learning to predict mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Users input data through a web app, which is preprocessed and analyzed by a pre-trained ML model. Results are displayed in real-time, with guidance provided if a consultant is unavailable. Developed with Flask, the system ensures high accuracy through continuous model updates. This tool aids early detection and intervention, benefiting healthcare providers, workplaces, educational institutions, and individuals by facilitating proactive mental health management.
